FetchArtifactFromAncestorUI
===========================

Setup of contexts
* Basic Configuration - setup
* Using pipeline "uppest_pipeline, upper_pipeline, upper_peer_pipeline, up_pipeline, down_pipeline" - setup
* Capture go state "FetchMaterialFromAncestorUI" - setup

FetchArtifactFromAncestorUI
---------------------------

tags: Fetch Artifact

* On Job settings page of pipeline "down_pipeline" stage "down-stage2" job "down-job2"
* Add task "Fetch Artifact"
* Set task pipeline as "$uppest_pipeline$/$upper_pipeline$/$up_pipeline$"
* Set task stage as "uppest-stage1"
* Set task job as "uppest-job1"
* Set task source file as "source_file"
* Check source is a file option
* Set task destination as "dest_dir"
* Save task changes

* On Swift Dashboard Page
* Looking at pipeline "down_pipeline" - On Swift Dashboard page
* Edit pipeline "parent-left"
* Open "Materials" tab - On Pipeline settings page
* Select add new material of type "Pipeline"
* Set pipeline and stage as "$uppest_pipeline$:uppest-stage2"
* Save material

* Verify that material "$uppest_pipeline$" can be deleted
* Verify that material "$up_pipeline$" can be deleted

* Delete material with name "$up_pipeline$"
* Verify the error message "Pipeline named '$up_pipeline$' exists, but is not an ancestor of '$down_pipeline$' as declared in '$uppest_pipeline$/$upper_pipeline$/$up_pipeline$'." is present
