[![Gauge Badge](https://cdn.rawgit.com/getgauge/getgauge.github.io/master/Gauge_Badge.svg)](https://gauge.org)

## Pre-Requisites(with versions tested on)

* Java 12

* Ruby 2.7.1

* Rake 13.0.1

* Bundler 2.1.4

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) v14.3.0

* [Gauge](https://gauge.org/index.html) 1.0.8

* gauge-ruby plugin (depends on the version of gauge used):

  For gauge version 1.0.3: Make sure gauge-ruby is at 0.5.2.
  For gauge version 1.0.8: Make sure gauge-ruby is at 0.5.3.

  You might have to run `bundle update` to get the right version. Look inside `vendor/bundle` to find the correct, installed version and don't depend on the output of `gauge --version`.

* Firefox >= 45.0 (verified with Firefox 76.0.1)

* geckodriver 0.26.0

* jq

## Setup

```
# Make sure these are sibling directories.
git clone https://github.com/gocd/ruby-functional-tests ruby-functional-tests
git clone https://github.com/gocd/gocd gocd
git clone https://github.com/gocd/go-plugins go-plugins

cd ruby-functional-tests
gauge install
```

## Prepare and run specs

1. Build GoCD server and agent zip installers:

    ```
    cd gocd
    ./gradlew clean installers:agentGenericZip installers:serverGenericZip test:test-addon:assemble
    ```

2. Build GoCD plugins API library:

    ```
    cd gocd
    ./gradlew -PfastBuild --parallel --max-workers 2 plugin-infra:go-plugin-api:install plugin-infra:go-plugin-api-internal:install installers:versionFile
    ```

3. Build GoCD plugins:

    ```
    cd go-plugins
    ./gradlew clean assemble copyJarsToOnePlace -PgoVersion=$(jq '.go_full_version' -r ../gocd/installers/target/distributions/meta/version.json)
    ```

4. Install Ruby gems for functional tests:

    ```
    cd ruby-functional-tests
    bundle install
    ```

5. Clean and prepare server and agent for functional tests:

    ```
    cd ruby-functional-tests
    bundle exec rake GO_VERSION='X.x.x' clean_test server:prepare agent:prepare
    ```

    You can find the right version to use for `GO_VERSION` by checking the zip installers created in step 1 above, in: `gocd/installers/target/distributions/zip`. If the installer created is: `go-server-20.4.0-11553.zip`, then `GO_VERSION` should be set to `20.4.0`.

6. To run all specs:

    ```
    cd ruby-functional-tests
    bundle exec rake GO_VERSION='X.x.x' GAUGE_TAGS='<spec tags to run>' test
    ```

7. To run specific task(s), execute this command

    ```
    cd ruby-functional-tests
    bundle exec rake [kill/clean/prepare/test/bump-schema] GO_VERSION='X.x.x' GAUGE_TAGS='<spec tags to run>'
    ```

    * `kill` - Kills all running processes spun by the tests.
    * `clean_test` - Cleans all directories (`ruby-functional-tests/target`, `ruby-functional-tests/reports`).
    * `prepare` - Initializes the filesystem to run tests.
    * `test` - Runs the gauge tests with specified tags.
    * `bump-schema` - Bump up schema version. Example: `VERSION=99 rake bump-schema`


## Potential troubleshooting tips:

### 1. Check that the GoCD server has started

- Ensure that you have run the prepare step above, so that the server and agent are ready to be started.

- Try and access http://localhost:8253

- Check the logs in: `target/go-server-*/logs`

### 2. Check resource/with-java.sh

- It uses jabba to install Java if needed. Make sure that the version of Java being used is correct.

### 3. Ensure that you have the right version of gauge-ruby installed.

If you have the wrong version, it might show up like this:

```shell
$ bundle exec rake test GO_VERSION='20.4.0' GAUGE_TAGS='my-tags'
bundle exec gauge --tags 'duck' run specs

You can see in the above output that the version of gauge-ruby in `vendor/bundle` is `gauge-ruby-0.5.2` and the version Gauge seems to be expect is `0.5.3` (that you can see in the "Your Environment Information" section at the end).
