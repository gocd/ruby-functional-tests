[![Gauge Badge](https://cdn.rawgit.com/getgauge/getgauge.github.io/master/Gauge_Badge.svg)](https://gauge.org)

## Pre-Requisites

* Java + Ruby + [Gauge](https://gauge.org/index.html).
  * Consult [.tool-versions](.tool-versions).
* gauge-ruby plugin (depends on the version of gauge used):
  * You might have to run `bundle update` to get the right version. Look inside `vendor/bundle` to find the correct, installed version and don't depend on the output of `gauge --version`.
* Firefox >= 45.0 (verified with Firefox 95)
* [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
  * On Mac you can `brew install geckodriver` for latest version 
* jq
* Whatever requirements are needed for building and running GoCD Server
  * Check the main repo [.tool-versions](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/.tool-versions) for an indication

## Setup

```shell
# Make sure these are sibling directories.
git clone https://github.com/gocd/ruby-functional-tests ruby-functional-tests
git clone https://github.com/gocd/gocd gocd
git clone https://github.com/gocd/go-plugins go-plugins

cd ruby-functional-tests
gauge install
```

## Prepare and run specs

1. Build GoCD installer and plugins API library:

    ```shell
    cd ../gocd
    ./gradlew clean installers:agentGenericZip installers:serverGenericZip -PfastBuild publishToMavenLocal installers:versionFile
    ```

2. Build GoCD plugins:

    ```shell
    cd ../go-plugins
    ./gradlew clean assemble copyJarsToOnePlace -PgoVersion=$(jq '.go_full_version' -r ../gocd/installers/target/distributions/meta/version.json)
    ```

3. Install Ruby gems for functional tests:

    ```shell
    cd ../ruby-functional-tests
    bundle install
    ```

4. Clean and prepare server and agent for functional tests:

    ```shell
    cd ../ruby-functional-tests
    bundle exec rake GO_VERSION='X.x.x' clean_test server:prepare agent:prepare
    ```

    You can find the right version to use for `GO_VERSION` by checking the zip installers created in step 1 above, in: `gocd/installers/target/distributions/zip`. If the installer created is: `go-server-20.4.0-11553.zip`, then `GO_VERSION` should be set to `20.4.0`.

5. To run all specs:

    ```shell
    cd ../ruby-functional-tests
    bundle exec rake GO_VERSION='X.x.x' GAUGE_TAGS='<spec tags to run>' test
    ```

6. To run specific task(s), execute this command

    ```shell
    cd ../ruby-functional-tests
    bundle exec rake [kill/clean/prepare/test/bump-schema] GO_VERSION='X.x.x' GAUGE_TAGS='<spec tags to run>'
    ```

    * `kill` - Kills all running processes spun by the tests.
    * `clean_test` - Cleans all directories (`ruby-functional-tests/target`, `ruby-functional-tests/reports`).
    * `prepare` - Initializes the filesystem to run tests.
    * `test` - Runs the gauge tests with specified tags.
    * `bump-schema` - Bump up schema version. Example: `VERSION=99 rake bump-schema`


## Potential troubleshooting tips:

### 1. Check that the GoCD server has started

- Ensure that you have run the prepare step above, so that the server and agent are ready to be started.

- Try and access http://localhost:8253

- Check the logs in: `target/go-server-*/logs`

### 2. Check you have an appropriate Java version installed

- The scripts assume there is an appropriate Java version available on the path.
- On CI we use [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) for this - see [.tool-versions](.tool-versions) for appropriate
  version, or use `mise install` if you already use Mise. [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/) will likely also work.

### 3. Ensure that you have the right version of gauge-ruby installed.

If you have the wrong version, it might show up like this:

```
$ bundle exec rake test GO_VERSION='20.4.0' GAUGE_TAGS='my-tags'
bundle exec gauge --tags 'duck' run specs

```

You can see in the above output that the version of gauge-ruby in `vendor/bundle` is `gauge-ruby-0.5.2` and the version Gauge seems to be expect is `0.5.3` (that you can see in the "Your Environment Information" section at the end).
